<h4>About the Project</h4>

<p>
    Although not a native of Durham, I first developed an interest in the county when I began researching my family history in Weardale many years ago.
    Trawling through early parish records, it soon became apparent how spellings of surnames varied widely between parish registers.
    Although one would expect curates to be literate, some were not.
    Very often they were not from the parish and would not be familiar with the spelling of some surnames, and names might have been spelt differently if they had moved from one curacy to another.
    In the 16<sup>th</sup> century (and later) the majority of the inhabitants were illiterate, so spellings were largely down to the literacy or imagination of a curate or vicar.
</p>

<p>
    In 2004 I began transcribing parish registers of baptisms, marriages and burials [mainly from a collection of manuscripts bequeathed to Newcastle Library by the genealogist, Herbert Maxwell Wood] and I wanted to concentrate my efforts on records that were not easily accessible to researchers.
    At the time I was unsure how I would make use of the database created, but in 2006 I joined Durham Records Online as a contributor of vital event data and local history material.
    While many parish datasets on the website already existed for varying periods between 17-19<sup>th</sup> centuries, an opportunity arose to upload the early parish register material I had accumulated.
</p>

<p>
    A particular interest in the Tudor period led me to the publication <i>"Population trends in North East England, 1548-1563"</i>, which provides a good understanding of the demographic history of mid-Tudor North East.
    It may be worth noting that the population of what is now County Durham in 1569 was about 75,000.
    An interest in both demographics and statistics prompted me to perform an in-depth analysis of the spread of surnames in Durham in the sixteenth century.
    It was with this in mind that I undertook a self-funding, major research project in 2014, known as the Durnam (<b><u>Dur</u></b>ham Sur<b><u>nam</u></b>es) project, which aimed to gather information, study and analyse the geographic and historic distribution of surnames, as well as somehow visualising the population numbers and trends.
    It became clear that there was merit in putting the collected data on a statistical basis, in other words, quantifying the examples of each version of the surname.
    I reasoned that analysing the frequency may be helpful in distinguishing the genuine variants from those fleeting versions arising from simple errors.

<h4>Website</h4>

<p>
    The creation of a website and sister site to Durham Records Online was a natural progression, mainly because it facilitates ongoing research work, enables quick updates and, perhaps more importantly, it also provides the means for researchers of their Durham ancestry to search parishes and years of vital events, and then go onto Durham Records Online to obtain further information about individuals.
</p>

<p>
    The principal source of database records is some 60,000 entries of baptisms, marriages and burials, between 1538-1599, in surviving 16C registers of fifty seven parish churches in the diocese of Durham.
    Other valuable sources which are a work in progress include the collection of Halmote Court books (Manorial records), commencing in 1519; Wills and Probate from 1537; Calenders of Patent Rolls (Pardons for Rising in the North in 1569), Homberston's Survey of 1570, and various Quarter Sessions, Bishop's administrative records and periodic official surveys.
    As a means of capturing the myriad of surnames recorded in pre-parish registers, their inclusion within the 'Births' category of vital events was conceived.
    If for example, an individual is recorded in a manorial court roll in 1519 he will be identified as a 'birth' in 1500.
    Eventually, Durham Records Online will hold a transcript of each of these records.
</p>

<p>
    In all instances, surnames have been transcribed as they appear in the record, even when it is thought that the clerk made a mistake.
    No attempt has been made to normalise surnames because of the danger of making false assumptions.
    However, a concerted effort has been made to determine the primary name â€“ being the most commonly used and generally accepted, and associated variant and deviant spellings have been linked so that they display also.
    My decisions on variant spellings are based on the study of surnames by P.H. Reaney and family names by David Hey; considerable involvement with parish registers and seventeenth century returns, and have been made without the luxury of acquiring genealogical evidence by tracing any particular family line back.
    In this regard, I apologize for any errors and inconsistencies, and welcome viewpoints and constructive criticism.
</p>

<p>
    Research work and data uploading is ongoing, and as the site grows steadily, it is hoped that it will develop beyond merely a platform for discovering surnames and their variants, and together with it's sister site emerge as the pre-eminent online source of information on Durham inhabitants during Tudor times.
    Who knows, it may even pave the way for <u>seventeenth</u> century data to be presented in the same way.
